        etc</h4>
    <!-- <p>Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

        Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.</p> -->

    <!-- The <section> element defines a section in a document.

                According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."

                Contact information -->


    <!-- The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

                An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.
                
                Examples of where the <article> element can be used:

                Product cards
                Newspaper articles -->

    <!-- The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

                A <header> element typically contains:
                
                one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
                logo or icon
                authorship information
                Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.    
             -->


    <!-- The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section.

            A <footer> element typically contains:
            
            authorship information
            copyright information
            contact information
            sitemap
            back to top links
            related documents
            You can have several <footer> elements in one document.  -->



    <!-- The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.    

                <nav>
                    <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
                    <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
                    <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
                    <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
                    </nav> -->

    <!-- The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).

                The <aside> content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.         -->



    <!-- The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

                The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a <figure> element.
                
                The <img> element defines the actual image/illustration.  -->

    <h4>Multimedia audio and video tags</h4>


    <!-- The HTML5 <audio> and <video> tags make it simple to add media to a website. You need to set src attribute to
            identify the media source and include a controls attribute so the user can play and pause the media. -->

    <!-- <video src = "foo.mp4"  width = "300" height = "200" controls>
                Your browser does not support the <video> element.   
             </video> -->

    <!-- <audio src = "foo.wav" controls autoplay>
                Your browser does not support the <audio> element.   
             </audio> -->




    <!-- Example of adding different formats of audio files:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <head>
        <title>Title of the document</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="/build/audios/jingle_bells.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
            <source src="/build/audios/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <p>Click the play button</p>
    </body>

    </html> -->

    <!-- The most popular audio formats are the following ones:

    MP3 – the most popular audio format, which uses lossy compression and permits to reduce the file size. Despite the
    popularity among the users, TV companies and radio stations use more modern codecs ISO-MPEG, like AAC or MPEG-H.

    AAC (Advanced Audio Codec) — closed codec, MP3 analog, but comparing to the latter, it provides higher quality with
    the same or stronger compression degree.

    Ogg — free format with an open code, supported in Firefox, Opera and Chrome. Provides good quality sound, but
    not sufficiently supported by device players. -->


    <!-- <video controls>
        <source src=”http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.ogv” type="video/ogg">
        <source src="/build/videos/arcnet.io(7-sec).mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video> -->

    <!-- controls This attribute allows us to show various controls like play, pause, volume adjustments, full-screen icon,
    and 3 dots which even allows you to download the video file over your video. You just have to write controls as an
    attribute. -->
